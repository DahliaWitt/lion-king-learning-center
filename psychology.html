    <p><b>Relation to Lion King</b></p>
    <p>Disney’s <i>Lion King</i> has numerous scenes that can be connected with psychological concepts and stages.
        Children from ages 0-13, Disney’s intended audience, may be in different stages and will perceive the themes
        expressed in this film differently, and will learn different things. Children in Piaget’s preoperational stage,
        (ages 2-7), will learn that symbols can represent ideas. For instance, children will learn that Mufasa, rather
        than simply being Simba’s father, represents a paternal figure for responsibility over land and people. Also,
        the <i>Lion King</i> introduces abstract through Mufasa’s emotional manipulation of Simba. This is still too
        abstract for children, however it helps broaden their emotional capacity and perspective, which is vital for
        their development to adolescence. Additionally, the <i>Lion King </i>engages with children in Erik Erikson’s
        ‘Autonomy vs Shame and Doubt’ and ‘Initiative vs Guilt’ stages, through the theme of independence. By
        illustrating Simba’s growing self sustainability and life away from his home, the <i>Lion King </i>encourages
        autonomy to young children. The <i>Lion King</i> also expresses the importance of attachment. Although Simba
        flees from his family and loses his father, he still makes strong parental-like bonds with Pumba and Timon.
        Disney highlights how attachment and relationships are essential in children’s lives, and can impact
        development. Because Timon and Pumba took Simba under their care, Simba had security, warmth, food and love.
        Furthermore, the <i>Lion King </i>draws parallels to the concept that children, early on, base nearly all of
        their actions to keep parental approval. Scar is a parental figure to Simba in the middle of the movie, and
        Simba is very obedient to him. When Scar tells Simba to run away after Mufasa’s death, Simba complies. This
        naivety and direct compliance to parental figures corresponds to children’s mindsets. However, by illustrating
        how Simba listening to Scar resulted in harm to the nation, the <i>Lion King </i>is introducing the idea that
        morality and actions should not always be based off parental approval, something that children grow to realize
        as they approach adolescence. </p>
